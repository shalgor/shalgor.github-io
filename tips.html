        <div class="header2">Keep your web browser up to date</div>
        <div class="col">
            <p class="info">Keeping your web browser (Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, etc.) will ensure that you are protected with the latest built in safety features.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="header2">Have strong and unique passwords for all your accounts</div>
        <div class="col">
            <p class="info">Having unique passwords for all of your accounts ensures that if one of your accounts is compromised, you only need to worry about one account, rather than all
                of the accounts you have. However, it is still a good idea to change all of your passwords regularly.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="header2">Look for "https://"</div>
        <div class="col">
            <p class="info">Be sure to look for "https://" in the beginning of the URL of the website you are browsing. This stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure," meaning that
                your data is being encrypted. This is different than "http://", which is not secure. You may also see a "padlock" next to the URL to indicate it is secure. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="header2">Don't download files from websites or people you don't trust</div>
        <div class="col">
            <p class="info">Never download files or share personal information with websites or people you dont know or trust, you never know what might be contained within the files
                you download or what might be done with your personal information.

        <div class="header2">Always be careful when giving personal information</div>
        <div class="col">
            <p class="info">Your personal information can be used to hack your accounts, so be careful when inputting it into websites.

        <div class="header2">When in doubt, close the site</div>
        <div class="col">
